Dear Cosmic Byte Team,

I hope you are Doing Well.
i have raised a ticket few weeks before 

link: https://support.thecosmicbyte.com/helpdesk/tickets/18245438

I asked you to repair my Cosmic Byte Pandora which was in warranty, 
The issue still persists and the team didn't check the Issue completely,

I have attached the files please look into it, when i claimed the warranty it was still in the warranty and when I recieved the product it was out of warranty this isnt a new issue this is the same issue.
At first it was just two led's so wasn't a big deal for me, now the issue is the control button.

please help, I know your team will help me out.

Thanks.
